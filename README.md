Part 8: Dungeon Master Information

Before players can take their characters on adventures into dun- geons, the DM must either create a dungeon or draw its map, or become familiar with one of TSR's dungeon modules. The "B" series of modules is designed for use with the D&D BASIC SET. The module included in this set may be used to start adventuring immediately, and will provide some ideas for designing dungeons.
This section gives a step-by-step guide to creating a dungeon. The guide is followed by an example of part of a dungeon level. The example follows the same steps as the guide and illustrates each step. A set of suggested symbols is included for DMs to use when drawing a dungeon map.
The same level is only part of a larger dungeon. The sample tower may be used to practice adventuring, and the dungeon outline may be useful if the DM wants to finish the dungeon.

A. CHOOSE A SCENARIO.
A scenario is a background theme or idea which ties the dungeon together. A scenario will help keep a dungeon from becoming a boring repetition of "open the door, kill the monster, take the treasure". A good scenario always gives the players a reason for adventuring. The DM should also design a dungeon for the levels of characters who will be playing in it. A good scenario will also give the DM a reason for choosing specific monsters and treasures to put in the dungeon.
A scenario may be anything the DM can imagine. To help new DMs, some common scenarios are listed below and explained. The DM can fill in the details.

Scenarios
1. Exploring the Unknown
2. Investigating a Chaotic Outpost 3. Recovering Ruins
4. Destroying an Ancient Evil
5. Visiting a Lost Shrine
6. Fulfilling a Quest
7. Escaping from Enemies 8. Rescuing Prisoners
9. Using a Magic Portal
10. Finding a Lost Race

1. Exploring the Unknown: The party is hired to map un- known territory. The area might once have been familiar but is now overrun or destroyed; a strange tower might mysteri- ously appear overnight in a familiar area. Dungeon modules Bl (In Search of the Unknown) and B3 (Palace of the Silver Princess) are examples of exploration scenarios.

2. Investigating a Chaotic Outpost: This scenario has to do with a Chaotic invasion (either in progress or about to be- gin). The characters must enter the enemy outpost, find out the strength and plans of the invaders, and destroy the out- post if possible. Dungeon module B2 (The Keep on the Borderlands) is an example of this type of scenario.

3. Recovering Ruins: The party is usually scouting an old vil- lage before permanent settlers move in. The ruins have often been overrun by a specific kind of monster which must be killed or driven away. The ruins could be part of (or underneath)athrivingtown!

4. Destroying an Ancient Evil: The evil is usually a monster or NPC (the exact type not known by the players). Some- times the evil has been deeply buried and re-awakened by recent digging. This theme is often used along with others; for example, an ancient evil may have to be destroyed be- fore some ruins are resettled.

5. Visiting a Lost Shrine: To remove a curse or recover a sacred item, the players must travel to a shrine which has been lost for ages. The characters usually have only a rough idea of its location. The players may have to consult an oracle or seer during their visit.

6. Fulfilling a Quest: This is a scenario in which a king (or other NPC) provides a reason for adventuring. A variation of this is a special mission for "the gods". Quite often this scenario also involves the recovery of a sacred object or powerful magic item.

7. Escaping from Enemies: The player characters begin this adventure as prisoners, and must escape. The reason is clear and simple, especially if imprisonment is to be followed by the deaths of the characters. The DM must be careful to make escape possible (though not necessarily easy).

8. Rescuing Prisoners: Valuable and important persons are being held prisoners by bandits, a tribe of ores, or an evil magic-user. The party sets out to rescue the prisoners be- cause they have been hired to (for an expected reward), for a debt of honor, or for some other reason. Sometimes the player characters are only hired to guard an individual who is talking over the demands for ransom. This scenario is the basis for the sample dungeon hereafter (The HAUNTED KEEP).

9. Using a Magic Portal: The "magic portal" is a device which magically sends creatures from one place to another. A magic portal is usually a door into another dimension or world, and thus may easily become the point of an invasion from one of these worlds. Portals may be known or secret. If known, the characters may be on a mission to destroy or guard a portal used by enemies, or perhaps to reopen or re- pair a "closed" portal. Secret portals can be used to make sure that the characters will visit an important area of a dungeon. Portals might operate both ways, or one way only (teleporting into but not out of an area).

10. Finding a Lost Race: The players find a once-human race which has lived underground for so long that it has begun to change. Its members might have developed infravision, changed color, or begun to fall back into animal ways. This scenario works well when used with Destroying an Ancient Evil, since Lost Races are often servants of the ancient powers. This scenario requires extra work and imagination by the DM, since details for the Lost Race must be invented.

B. DECIDE ON A SETTING.
It is not necessary to draw a detailed map of the dungeon first, but it is useful to have a general idea of what it will look like. When de- ciding on the shape of the dungeon, the DM should also outline ideas for rooms or areas in the dungeon. A few common settings include:
​​1. Castle or tower
2. Caves or cavern 
3. Abandoned mine
4. Crypt or tomb
5. Ancient temple
6. Stronghold or town

C. DECIDE ON SPECIAL MONSTERS TO BE USED.
The DM should decide on what special monsters (not placed by using the Wandering Monster tables) will be used. Some monsters should be placed by the DM because of the scenario chosen, and the DM may create or change some monsters to fit the dungeon.

D. DRAW THE MAP OF THE DUNGEON.
A dungeon map is usually drawn on graph paper. The map should be made in pencil so that changes can be made. Before actually drawing the map, the DM should determine the scale. The scale of a map is the number of feet each square on the graph paper is equal to. Most maps are drawn to a scale of 10' per square. The scale depends on the size of the dungeon and rooms. If, for ex- ample, the rooms are all larger than 100' on a side, or if the dun- geon is thousands of feet long, the DM may wish to use a scale of 20' per square. On the other hand, a small tower such as the one in the following HAUNTED KEEP is better at 5' or 10' to a square.

The general shape of a dungeon is often determined by the setting. For example, a tower is usually round or square with smooth walls, while a cavern has an irregular shape and rough walls. If the DM has a good idea of where certain rooms and corridors will go, other sections of the map may be left blank, to be filled in later. Some standard dungeon symbols are given with the sample dungeon maps.

E. STOCK THE DUNGEON.
To "stock" a dungeon means to fill in the general details, such as monsters, treasure, and traps. Special monsters should be first placed in the appropriate rooms along with special treasures. The remaining rooms can be stocked as the DM wishes. If there is no preference as to how certain rooms are stocked, the following sys- tem may be used. Roll Id6 for CONTENTS, and then roll on the second table for TREASURE according to the result of the first roll. A "Yes" result means that Treasure is there along with whatever is indicated by the first roll.
First Roll: CONTENT
Second Roll: TREASURE?

A Monster result means that the DM should roll on a Wandering Monsters table to determine the type present. A Trap may be located in an empty room or on treasure. A Special is anything not exactly a trap, but placed for special reasons. The DM should make up traps and specials, but some suggestions are given below.

ROOM TRAPS:
Poison gas: Save vs. Poison or die
Fog: Looks like Poison gas, but harmless
Pit: Id6 points of damage per 10' fallen
Ceiling Block falls: Save vs. Turn to Stone or take Id 10 pointsof damage
Pendulum blade from ceiling: Id8 points of damage 
Chute: No damage, but slide to the next level down

TREASURE TRAPS:
Poison needle: Save vs. Poison or die
Spring-fired darts: 1-6 darts hit for 1-4 points of damage each 
Flash of light: Save vs. Spells or be blinded for Id8 turns
Poison snake (see SNAKE in monster descriptions)
Spray: Be sprayed with an unknown liquid that attracts
Wandering Monsters; double chances for Id6 hours 
Illusion: Anything; often a monster (as phantasmal force)

SPECIALS:
Moaning room or corridor
Room turns or sinks while the door locks 
Illusionary stairs or corridor
Shifting block to close off corridor
Trap door to tunnels
Alarm that summons special monster
Talking statue
Magic pool whose waters have a strange effect Magic gate to another part of the dungeon 
Flying weapons which attack only if disturbed

TREASURE: 
If treasure is in a room with a monster, use the Treasure Type for that monster (given in the monster description) to find the treasure in the room. If treasure is in a room without a monster, use the Unguarded Treasure table (below). The table is used in the same way as the Treasure Types table (page B45).

5%: 1d6
8%: Any1


'Note that there are always silver pieces in unguarded treasure, and that other items are given in terms of the die rolled to deter- mine the number present.

F. FILLING IN FINAL DETAILS.
Once the rooms have been stocked, the DM can fill in details about the corridors (such as traps or regular patrols of monsters). The DM should also "stock" the dungeon with some normal items, smells, sounds, and so forth. Inhabited and empty rooms could be given whatever normal furnishings would be common in the dungeon. The DM should be careful not to use too much nor too little detail; some detail will help the players imagine the areas that they are exploring, but too much detail is often just boring.

Creating an NPC Party
Since it takes time to create a fully detailed NPC party, many DMs will prefer to prepare them in advance for use as either Wandering Monsters or as planned encounters. The DM may choose the NPCs in a party or determine them randomly. A suggested system for rolling up an NPC party is as follows:

1. Determine the number of NPCs in the party: 
5-8 (roll 1d4 + 4).

2. Determine the class of each character (roll Id8):
1 Fighter
2 Magic-user 
3 Cleric
4 Thief
5 Dwarf 
6 Elf
7 Halfling 
8 Fighter

3. Determine the level of each character (roll Id6): 
1,2 First level
3,4 Second level
5,6 Third level

4. Determine the alignment of each character (roll Id6); the
DM may only roll once, if desired, and make all the align-
ments the same:
1,2 Lawful
3,4 Neutral
5,6 Chaotic

5. Randomly determine or choose any magic-user, elf, and
cleric spells.

6. Choose special treasures or roll for possible treasure (U+V). If a magic item is rolled up, a member of the NPC party will use it in combat if at all possible.

7. Decide on a marching order for the group.

Wandering Monsters
Besides the monsters which live in rooms, characters may en- counter monsters which wander about the dungeon. These monsters are known as "Wandering Monsters". At the end of every 2 turns, the DM should check for Wandering Monsters. To do so, roll Id6: a result of 1 indicates that the party will encounter a Wandering Monster in the next turn. The Wandering Monster will be 20-120 feet away from the party when encountered (roll 2d6, multiply the result by 10) in a direction of the DM's choosing, and will be headed toward the player characters.
Wandering monsters may be determined at random or selected by the DM. The Wandering Monster tables (below) give a balanced mixture of monsters for the dungeon levels. The DM may create his or her own tables. The dungeon may have certain areas where Wandering Monsters are encountered more often (such as on a roll of 1 or 2). The dungeon may have areas where the DM checks for Wandering Monsters every turn, or where a monster will ap- pear when a corridor is entered. Wandering Monsters should appear more often if the party is making a lot of noise or light, but should not be frequent if the party spends a long time in one out- of-the-way place (if they stop in a room for the night, for example).
The DM may want to create special wandering monster tables for specific areas or dungeons. These might include the monsters which live in the area, patrols, and animals (vermin) which can be found there. An example would be a cave complex with goblins liv- ing in it. A wandering monster table for this area could have en- counters with normal goblins, goblin patrols and perhaps a chance of running into bats or rats.
Most Wandering Monsters are the same level as the level of the dungeon (in other words, they have a number of hit dice equal to the number of the dungeon level). The "Number Appearing" of some monsters has been adjusted to make them more appropriate for encounters on a dungeon level.
Use the table for the dungeon level being explored. Roll ld20 to find the type of Wandering Monster. The information given will in- clude the alignment of the monster (A = Any alignment, L = Lawful, N = Neutral, C = Chaotic) and the following abbrevia- tions for other information: No. = Number Appearing; AC = Armor Class; HD = Hit Dice; Move = Movement rate per turn (followed by rate per round in parentheses); Save = Saving throw, using the abbreviations for Fighter (F), cleric (C), magic-user (M), thief (T), dwarf (D), elf (E), halfling (H), and normal man (NM).

WATERBORNE ADVENTURES
The sea is an awesome place, the home of terrible monsters, the source of unpredictable currents and strange mists, and the scene of terrible storms that can smash the strongest ship to splinters. Per- haps the most deadly of the sea's hazards, however, is the lack of landmarks. Once out of sight of land, there is little to steer by. A small mistake in navigation or a sudden storm can drive a ship hopelessly off course until a familiar shore is sighted. Only the bravest and most hardy adventurers dare challenge the sea!
Movement on rivers and lakes is handled in a similar manner to sea travel (including encounters and combat). The DM can add any restrictions as to vessel size, slower speed due to winding rivers, etc. as the circumstances dictate. Current may increase (or decrease if heading upstream) distance travelled by 7-12 (ld6 + 6) miles per day. Special hazards such as sand bars, rapids, waterfalls, and monsters can make river and lake travel almost as risky as ocean travel!

Hull Points. A ship's ability to remain afloat after taking in water or sustaining damage is given in a value called hull points. Hull points for a ship are very similar to hit points for a character; when a ship reaches zero or less hull points, it will sink in 1-10 rounds. Also, when a ship is reduced to zero or less hull points, it may no longer move under its own power or attack with ship-mounted weapons (catapult, etc.), although crew may use personal weapons normally.

Ship Modifications. Some ships can be modified for transport or combat. The costs and effects of these are listed below:
Adding a Ram — Large and Small galleys can add a ram for an additional V3 of the original ship's cost. War Galleys al- ready have a ram (included in their cost).
Troop Transport — Large and Small sailing ships can be con- verted into troop transports by paying an additional V3 of the original ship's cost. Troop transports have V3 more hull points than normal sailing ships, and carry twice as many troops (marines) as the normal vessel.
Catapult — Longships, any type of galley, and either type of sailed warship can add one light catapult (combat with these will be discussed later). Ordinary sailing ships, troop trans- ports, and the smaller vessels not mentioned above cannot mount a catapult. A catapult and 20 rounds of shot weigh 10,000 coins.


WEATHER
1 As stated before, the miles per day given above represents average 'sailing conditions. If the voyage is favored by steady winds and calm waters, the distance travelled might be as much as double what is given here. If the seas are rough, or the vessel is becalmed, little or no progress might be made in a day. See the optional Water Movement Modification Chart section for more details. 

SHIPS
In general, galleys are used for travel along the coast. River boats and rafts are used for travel on rivers and will almost surely be destroyed if they venture too far from shore. Below are given the average movement rates in miles travelled per day for the different types of crafts. Where two rates are given, the first is for rowing movement and the second is for sailing. Rowing during an en- counter is much faster than when used for long voyages.

In general, galleys stay near the coast, as they are not considered safe on the high seas. Likewise, river boats, rafts, and sailing boats will almost surely be destroyed if they venture too far onto great bodies of water; all rules for galleys apply to them as well.
If the optional Water Movement Modification Chart is not used, the following simple rules should apply. When sailing on seas or oceans, there is a chance that the weather will be unsuitable for travel. Two six-sided dice are rolled at the beginning of the day with a roll of 2 indicating no wind and a roll of 12 meaning gales or fierce storms. Sailing ships (not vessels with rowers) may not move if becalmed and must spend the entire day in the same hex or square. Rowed ships are never stopped for lack of wind; they are unaffected by calm weather. If a gale or storm is indicated, sailed ships may attempt to run before it. This will result in the ship moving at 3 times its normal movement rate in a random direction. If no coastline is reached during this movement, the ship has successfully run before the storm and is safe. If, however, the ship should reach a coastline or other shore before reaching the end of its movement, there is a 75% chance that the ship will be broken up in trying to beach, otherwise it will have found shelter. Galleys may not run before a storm. They have only a 20% chance of being able to weather any gale, with failure resulting in the ship being swamped. However, if the galley is in sight of the coastline, there is a chance that it will be able to beach before the storm hits. If the coastline is clear terrain, the galley will automatically find a beach. For any other type of terrain, roll a six-sided die with a result of 1-2 indicating that a safe beach or cove has been found.
It is assumed that all characters know how to swim, unless some circumstance might prevent this knowledge from being acquired. Swimming movement is equal to one-half the distance that charac- ter may normally travel. Characters in any type of metal armor may not swim, instead they will sink and drown.

ENCOUNTERS AT SEA
Visibility. Land can be seen at a distance of 24 miles on a clear day. The DM can reduce this for local conditions: night, fog, haze, storms, etc. Ships out of sight of land are lost unless a navigator is aboard. Approaching ships (encountered pirates, for example) can be seen and identified at 300 yards on a clear day, or can come as close as 40 yards in a dense fog before being spotted. Monsters are encountered at normal distances (40-240 yards).
Surprise. Monsters surprise ships as normal. Ships never receive surprise unless a special condition (such as fog) exists.
Evasion. Whenever an encounter at sea is indicated, the target can make one attempt to evade the pursuer (whether it's a ship or a monster). The chance to evade is based on the difference in speed between the opposing vessels. Each pursued ship has a sep- arate roll to evade.

Difference in Speed (per round), 
pursued vessel is

If Evasion is successfully rolled, the attacker has lost sight of the pursued vessel and cannot attempt to attack it again until the fol- lowing day (// it happens to be encountered again). If the Evasion attempt is not successful, the pursuing ship starts at the distance it is spotted at (300 yards on a clear day) and begins to close the distance. If the pursuing vessel is in the 0'-30' Speed Difference range (or is slower than the pursued ship), the pursuer will close at 30' (10 yards)/round. If the Speed Difference is greater than t 30'/round, the pursuer will close at that rate.

COMBAT AT SEA
Combat at sea is fought in combat rounds of 10 seconds each, with ramming taking place at the same time as missile fire. Once ships close, the crews will attempt to grapple and board the opponent. For boarding actions, it is helpful to have a sketch of the ships' deck plans. A scale of 1" = 5' is often convenient. Unless otherwise specified, most giant sea creatures and certain magic attacks will do 1 hull point of damage for every 5 points of normal damage the attack does.
Catapults. Light catapults can be mounted on some ships. They can throw rocks or flaming pitch at a range of 150 to 300 yards, but not at any close targets.
Light catapults need a crew of 4 for maximum efficiency. The catapult is fired every fifth round as long as four crew are left, every eighth round with three crew, every tenth round with two crew, and cannot be operated at all by one person. A catapult fires as a fighter of a level equal to the number of crew. Thus, if fired by a 3 man crew the DM would need to roll the same "to hit" score that a 3rd level would use. The DM may adjust this number for rough seas or other factors.
Rocks thrown by catapults affect a 10' x 10' area, and do 3-18 hull points of damage. Flaming pitch will set a 10' x 10' area on fire, doing 1-6 hull points of damage per turn of burning. The flames will spread if not fought by several crew: 5 crew can put the fire out in 3 turns; 10 crew can extinguish the flames in 2 turns; and 15 crew can put the flames out after 1 turn of burning. Pitch will always burn at least one turn regardless of the number of crew as- signed to fight the blaze.
Rams. Large and small galleys may be fitted with a ram on the bow. These are useful for striking large targets such as other ships or giant sea creatures. When making a ram attack, the chance to hit AC 9 is 10. One is added to the chance to hit for each armor class below 9 (i.e. a 12 is needed to hit AC 7). The DM may modify this because of weather, maneuverability, or other factors. Rams that hit other vessels will do 50-80 (ld4 + 4) points of damage (small galley ram) or 60-110 (ld6 + 5) points of damage (large or war galley ram); giant sea creatures will suffer 3-24 (3d8) points (small galley) or 6-36 (6d6) points (large or war galley) from rams. Small individual targets will be impossible to hit as they are able to outmaneuver the ramming vessel.
Repairing Hull Damage. Damage from any type of attack on a ship can be repaired at the rate of 1 hull point of damage per turn. This requires that at least 5 crew be assigned to repair duty during the entire turn. Because repairs at sea were makeshift, no more than V2 the damage sustained by a vessel can be repaired until the vessel returns to a port facility.
Ship Damage. Attempts to put out fires and repair hull damage take place after damage for the round is scored on the ship. Crew working at these tasks cannot do anything else. Each 10% of hull damage reduces speed by 10%. Each 10% loss of rowers reduces rowed speed by 10%.
Grappling and Boarding. If both ships' crews want to grapple, the attempt is automatic. If only one ship's crew wants to grapple, a 1 or 2 must be rolled on a Id6 for success. Grappling may be at- tempted each round that the ships are adjacent. Once the ships are grappled, the boarding battle is fought just like a large melee; how- ever, attackers boarding a ship attack and defend at -2 during the round they are boarding. The boarding action continues until the crew of one ship is killed or surrenders.
